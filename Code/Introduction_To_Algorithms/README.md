# Introduction to Algorithms

### Algorithms

# Algorithms are used to:
* Identify solutions to common problems
* Understand the efficiency of solutions to common problems
* Evaluate and break-down problems into distinct parts
# All algorithms must produce a result (output)

### Search Algorithms

#### Linear Search
- Every item in the collection is checked, regardless if sorted or not

#### Binary Search
- Requires a sorted collection
- Continuously split in the middle (and ask a comparison question)

#### Linear Search
##### Time Complexity
- Measures the time it takes for an algorithm to run

##### Space Complexity
Measures the storage used by an algorithm
