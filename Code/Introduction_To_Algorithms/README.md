# Introduction to Algorithms

### Algorithms are used to:
* Identify solutions to common problems
* Understand the efficiency of solutions to common problems
* Evaluate and break-down problems into distinct parts

### All algorithms must:
* Produce a result (output)

### Search Algorithms Types
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

### Linear Search
* Every item in the collection is checked, regardless if sorted or not

### Binary Search
* Requires a sorted collection
* Continuously split in the middle, and ask a comparison question

### Complexity
* Time Complexity - measures the time it takes for an algorithm to run
* Space Complexity - measures the storage used by an algorithm

### Constant and Logarithmic Time
* Constant Time, O(1) - where n is irrelevant; it doesn't matter if n is 1 or 1M - the algorithm takes the same amount of time to execute

* Logarithmic Time, O(log n) - as the data set increases, the algorithm's execution time increases logarithmically

### Linear and Quadratic Time
* Linear Time, O(n) - the algorithm's runtime  is directly proportional to the data set's size

* Quadratic Time - O(n^2) - the algorithm's runtime increases by a factor of n squared as the data set's size increases
