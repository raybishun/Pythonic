# Introduction to Algorithms

### Algorithms are used to:
* Identify solutions to common problems
* Understand the efficiency of solutions to common problems
* Evaluate and break-down problems into distinct parts

### All algorithms must:
* Produce a result (output)

### Search Algorithms Types
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

### Linear Search
* Every item in the collection is checked, regardless if sorted or not

### Binary Search
* Requires a sorted collection
* Continuously split in the middle, and ask a comparison question

### Complexity
* Time Complexity - measures the time it takes for an algorithm to run
* Space Complexity - measures the storage used by an algorithm
